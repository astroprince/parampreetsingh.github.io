								<b>What Local Magnetic Fields Can Teach Us About A Possible Supernova Remnant (G182.5-4.0) - Undergraduate Research Thesis</b><br>Aided in the study to
								classify a currently unknown object called G182.5-4.0. The classification was done by focusing on the role of the
								interstellar magnetic field which is known to permeate this object. The field was probed through data provided by the Dominion
								Radio Astrophysical Observatory Synthesis Telescope (DRAO-ST) and the G-ALFA Continuum Transit Survey (GALFACTS) Arecibo Telescope, 
								as well as the Rolling Hough Transform (RHT) and RM-Synthesis python algorithms.
